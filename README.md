# Weightlifting-Tracker

MVP (Minimum Viable Project): {

This project will create a site that allows users to track their progress in weightlifting and powerlifting. The user can input information about each of their workouts (what exercises they did, sets, repetitions, etc.). The site will track the users daily, weekly, and monthly progress on their most important lifts (squat, deadlift, press, etc.), and allow the user to share their progress.

The site will display graphs of the user's progress over time, their current "level" (novice, intermediate, advanced, or elite) based on charts from exrx.net, and recommendations for improving their weaknesses.

}

Additional Features, as time allows: {

The site will provide a menu of recommended programs based on the user's stated goal (strength maintenance, general strength, powerlifting, Olympic-style weightlifting) and current rate of progress.

Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) has become a very popular tool in powerlifting programming as an alternative to percentage-based programming. Users can rate sets according to RPE, and this will be incorporated into determining the user's current 1RMs and rate of progress using charts to convert RPE to 1RM

Because users are unlikely to enter their information after every workout, the site will interpolate between datapoints to figure out how fast they are progressing.

Each recommended program can be rated by users, and the generated listed of recommended programs can be listed in descending order of rating. That way, the user can get an idea of which programs other lifters are having success with, and which programs are less successful.

The site will also provide information on the user's relative strengths and weaknesses, and recommend accessory lifts to bring up his or her weaknesses.

The user's progress can be extrapolated to predict future progress.

The user can have a history of programs attempted and information on their progress (or lack thereof) on each program.
