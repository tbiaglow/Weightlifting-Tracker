  "description": "MVP: {\r This project will create a site that allows users to track their progress in weightlifting and powerlifting. The site will track daily, weekly, and monthly progress on basic lifts, and recommend a program based on the user's stated goal (strength maintenance, general strength, powerlifting, Olympic lifting) and current rate of progress.\r     What I know how to do:\r         1. Create a database in SQL or Mongo for each user, update each database, add to each database\r         2. Create a database of programs that are associated with different user goals and rates of progress\r     What I need to know how to do:\r         1. Use data to calculate rate of progress and store this as an dynamic object that updates automatically when the user adds to their progress database\r         2. Get functions that calculate 1 rep max for any given number of reps, add that number to the database as a 1RM snapshot value",
